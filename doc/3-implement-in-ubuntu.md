since I have code develop in windows need to:
1. create folder for msp api: (.........................)
2. create virtual environment for msp api: (.........................)
3. look at jdb documentation and do the same
4. create .env for database specification
5. create apb_msp service (see also 27 in jdb doc and put here your new one)
5. test
5. after testing check how to compile
