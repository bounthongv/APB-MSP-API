 Here is the guide to set it up on the Ubuntu server:

  1. Upload the Service File
  Upload the apb_api.service file you just created to the server (e.g., using SFTP or SCP) and move it to /etc/systemd/system/.

  On the server:
   1 mv apb_api.service /etc/systemd/system/

  2. Install Dependencies (on Server)
  Ensure waitress and other requirements are installed:
   1 cd /root/apb_api
   2 pip install -r requirements.txt

  3. Start the Service
  Run these commands on the server to enable and start the API:

   1 # Reload systemd to see the new file
   2 systemctl daemon-reload
   3 
   4 # Start the service
   5 systemctl start apb_api
   6 
   7 # Enable it to start on boot
   8 systemctl enable apb_api

  4. Check Status
  Verify it's running:

   1 systemctl status apb_api
  You should see Active: active (running).
